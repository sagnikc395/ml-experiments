# ml-experiments
implementing some classical ML and Word learning architectures and papers for the fun of it 

## about
- I'm currently taking COMPSCI689 and COMPSCI685 for my first semester courses
for my masters.

- I wanted to write and practice using software that I have to use in class
for assignments and exams along with implementing simple experiments that will help
me in learning more about the underlying architecture.

- So it is currently divided into 2 sections:
  - NLP -> focuses mostly on different model architectures and their implementations in PyTorch.
  - ML -> focuses mostly on different machine learning implementations using JAX and numpyro.
